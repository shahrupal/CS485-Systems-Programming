Assignment: Program 5 Network Programming and System I/O

Description:
- This program uses a client and server to communicate with each other. 
- First, the secret key must match for both the client and server, otherwise both sides will quit.
- If the secret key matches, the user may input the following commands via the client-side:
  * cput <filename>
  * cget <filename>
  * cdelete <filename>
  * clist
- Both the client and server will work together to undergo these commands.
- The server will output the following for each command requested by the user:
  * type
  * key
  * status
  * filename


Limitations:
- There is very limited input validation. My program assumes the user will correctly implement inputs. For example, it does not account for if a user inputs an incorrect amount of arguments for the 5 commands. 
- Program quits when user inputs invalid command.
- The 'clist' command always outputs as a success -- I could not find any way that an error would occur.
- The 'cput' command does not output a filename on the server-side if invalid.
